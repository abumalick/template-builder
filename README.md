# Template builder

This project is my first React app. I am keeping it for history.

It is a template builder for those that have to modify same html templates for posting on an old website.

You can add new template by creating new js file in `src/templates` folder, and add the filename in `src/templates/index.js`.

In this project we use :

- [flexboxgrid](http://flexboxgrid.com/)
- [handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)
- [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked)

## Installation

To install the project :

- install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
- clone this repo
- install dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn`
- run the development server: `npm run start` or `yarnpkg start`
